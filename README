I spent summer of 1984 as an intern at the ESCOM office in Cape
Town where the two big highlights were some PCs that had CGA 
graphics (the first color graphics for PC) as well as an HP
plotter. My wonderful boss Carine pretty much let me have free
reign on these and these programs were the result.
